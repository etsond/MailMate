# MailMate
PyMail is a Python script that allows you to send emails from the command line using the Gmail API. The script prompts the user to enter the recipient's email address, the subject of the email, and the body of the email. The email is then sent using the Gmail API.

Installation
To run this script, you must have Python installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the pymail directory.
3. Follow the instructions on the [Gmail API Quickstart guide](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python) to set up the Gmail API and obtain a credentials.json file.
4. Replace the credentials.json file in the pymail directory with your own credentials.json file.
## Usage
Once you have set up the Gmail API and replaced the credentials.json file with your own, you can run the script by executing the pymail.py file in your terminal:

```ruby
python pymail.py
```
The script will prompt you to enter the recipient's email address, the subject of the email, and the body of the email. Once you have entered this information, the email will be sent using the Gmail API.
